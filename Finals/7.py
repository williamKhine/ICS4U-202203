# Number 7 Multiple Choice Question
# The question has so many bugs and has lost or syntax errors.
# Original Code:

def main():
    myCount – Count()     # this is a typo, it should be "=" not "–"
    times = 0
for i in range(0, 100):   # this should be indented to the main function
    increment (myCount, times)
print(“myCount.count =”’ myCount.count, “times =”, times)
def increment(c, times)
    c.count += 1
    times += 1
class Count:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

main()


# I debugged the code and got this code

def main():
    myCount = Count()
    times = 0

    for i in range(0, 100):
        increment(myCount, times)

    print("myCount.count =", myCount.count, "times =", times)


def increment(c, times):
    c.count += 1
    times += 1


class Count:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0


main()

# Output:
# myCount.count = 100 times = 0
# So the answer to question 7 is "B"
