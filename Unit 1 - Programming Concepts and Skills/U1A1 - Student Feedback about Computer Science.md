##### Why did you take the course Computer Science?
I took the course because I am truly passionate in the field of technology and invested in it. Since young, I have been surrounded by computers and had the opportunity to play around with them, in both software and hardware aspects. I have been proficient in using computers and know the true potential of how this technology can be used to make lives easier by automating things and getting work done with less effort. So I started learning to code and have build a couple programs and websites myself. I took this course to further my knowledge in computers, diving in depth on how they work on a binary level. 

##### What are your future plans?
My future plans include attending the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Canada, and build my career around this skillset. I have not yet decided on which position to go in this field but I have my eyes on Software Engineer, CyperSecurity Engineer, or a Systems Administrator. 

##### What data languages have you learnt?
During my school years, I started off with HTML and CSS. Later on picking up JavaScript to build more responsive webpages. I have also learnt some web frameworks such as Bootstrap and Vue. 
In the family of non-web languages, I know Java, and C++ which I taught myself before attending grade 12. I also know Bash which I use to inteact with Linux systems.
